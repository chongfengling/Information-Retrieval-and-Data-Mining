\section{Task 4: Query Likelihood Language Models}
\subsection{Compare of three models}
We select some query-passage pairs with a high rank for each model.
\subsubsection{qid=1108939: what slows down the flow of blood}
Corresponding passage with the highest score.
\\\\
Laplace: pid=2555774, score=-1497107
\\
"Capable of undergoing vasoconstriction or vasodilation to influence blood flow and blood pressure"
\\\\ 
Lidstone: pid=2068541, score=-24.69
\\
"An aortic aneurysm can also lead to other problems. Blood flow often slows in the bulging section of an aortic aneurysm, causing clots to form. If a blood clot breaks off from an aortic aneurysm in the chest area, it can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.Blood clots that break off from an aortic aneurysm in the belly area can block blood flow to the belly or legs.n aortic aneurysm can also lead to other problems.

\subsubsection{qid=1121986: what are the effects of having low blood sugar}
Corresponding passage with the tenth highest score.
\\\\
Laplace: pid=1188148, score=-1497113
\\
An insulin overdose can cause low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia), which can be quite dangerous. Some of the early symptoms of low blood sugar include:
\\\\
Lidstone: pid=7518992, score=-33.91
\\
Hypoglycemia refers to blood sugar levels that drop below the normal range. When blood sugar becomes too low, the body releases a hormone called epinephrine, which causes the body to release stored sugar into the blood. Epinephrine produces symptoms such as hunger, sweating, and shaking. As blood sugar drops even more, the body cannot get enough sugar to the brain, and additional symptoms develop due to the decrease in sugar to the brain. This causes dizziness, confusion, and weakness. As blood sugar continues to drop, and the brain does not have enough sugar to function properly, more severe effects occur, including permanent brain damage, seizures, coma, and death.
\\\\
Dirichlet: pid=2899538, score=-14.74
\\
Tresiba® may cause serious side effects that can be life-threatening, including: 1  Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Signs and symptoms that may indicate low blood sugar include anxiety, irritability, mood changes, dizziness, sweating, confusion, and headache.  Low potassium in your blood (hypokalemia)
\subsubsection{Analysis}
Dirichlet Model is expected to be the better one among three models. 
\\
As Laplace Smoothing consider too much weight about unseen terms, the term "slow" does not occur in the passage 3130232. On the other, the vocabulary size ($10^6$) is much large than a normal query ($10^1$) thus the score of different passage for a query are controlled by unseen terms and has low variance.
\begin{equation}
    P_{laplace}(w \mid D)=\frac{t f_{w, D}+1}{|D|+|V|}
\end{equation}
\\
Lidstone model is an adapted model of Laplace model by changing 1 to a empirical parameter $\varepsilon$. What they do is add some weight to unseen weights and Lidstone model use a parameter to control the level of weights.
\begin{equation}
    P_{lidstone}(w \mid D)=\frac{t f_{w, D}+\varepsilon}{|D|+\varepsilon|V|}
\end{equation}
\\
Dirichlet Model is a better estimator for short queries. It makes smoothing depends on sample size and works better in this case.
\subsection{Similarity of models}
Laplace model and Lidstone model are similar because they use the same method to share weights on the unseen words. Laplace model is a special case of Lidstone model ($\varepsilon = 1$). Both of them do not consider the statistical knowledge about the whole vocabularies.

\subsection{Choice of $\epsilon$ in the Lidstone model}
$\varepsilon = 0.1$ is a good choice in our data collection. In our collection, the size of vocabulary is about $10^6$ and the average length of a passage is about $3\times10^1$. A small $\varepsilon$ can reduce the weights on the unseen tokens.

\subsection{Change $\mu$ to 5000 in Dirichlet Smoothing}
$\lambda = \frac{N}{N+\mu}$, in our case, the average length of a passage is about $3\times10^1$. If we set $\mu=5\times10^3$, the $\lambda$ will reduce to 0 nearly, that is, we put too much confidence in background information and do not consider the information in a specific passage. $\mu=5\times 10^1$ could be a good parameter in this dataset.
